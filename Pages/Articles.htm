      <div align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ideology 
        and Revolution (Part One)<br>
        During a series of discussions with friends of both leftist and liberal 
        persuasions I recently encountered two classic objections to the Marxist 
        perspective. Upon consideration I believe them to be derived from the 
        same misunderstanding of the nature of a socialist revolution. The first 
        objection was in the idealist tradition and centred on the connection 
        between the Enlightenment and the Soviet gulags. I had heard of the terror 
        of the French revolution being associated with Enlightenment ideals but 
        not of its connection, via that incarnation of reason named Karl Marx, 
        with the Bolshevik concentration camps. The other accusation was that 
        it was naive to expect a socialist revolution to be any different than 
        those that preceded it historically. In an attempt to deal with these 
        closely associated criticisms we have to unravel the relationship between 
        the ideologies proclaimed by those involved and the historical context 
        of their actions. As Marx would say - we have to cut away the ideological 
        overgrowth to get to the political reality. Socialists have long believed 
        that to view history as primarily a progression of ideas (idealism) is 
        very misleading and politically dangerous. However it is of significance 
        why certain ideals were used during periods of political upheaval rather 
        than others; not just in terms of propaganda but also culturally and linguistically. 
        Why was the memory and traditions associated with an obscure Jewish prophet 
        of some 2,000 years ago invoked by the Puritans of the English revolution; 
        why did the emperor Napoleon defend his dictatorship with reference to 
        the Enlightenment and why did the Bolsheviks believe they could claim 
        Marxist credentials? These three revolutions were successful partly because 
        of the motivation that these ideologies provided for those who did the 
        fighting and dying; or rather, the specific interpretation of those ideologies 
        at the time. It might be informative to analyse these ideologies in terms 
        of their origins, their cultural and linguistic reinterpretation and their 
        use as propaganda. All of this can be done in the context of the similarities 
        and differences they represent with the proposed model of a socialist 
        revolution. We begin with the English Revolution of 1642.<br>
        Europe had witnessed the persecution of Jan Huss and John Wycliffe for 
        their opposition to the widespread corruption within the Catholic Church 
        but it was not until the time of their protestant progeny Martin Luther 
        that the Reformation became politically important. Many European potentates 
        were tired of the political interference and high taxes that emanated 
        from Rome. One of these, a German Prince Frederick III, saw in Luther&#8217;s 
        protest a way to weaken the political power of the Holy Roman Empire. 
        Thus Luther&#8217;s protection by the powerful, in contrast with Huss 
        and Wycliffe, made it possible to promote the Reformation which in turn 
        eventually enabled a political formulation of the nation state that was 
        independent of Rome. All of this was accelerated by the new technology 
        of the printing press which made possible the first dissemination of mass 
        political/religious propaganda in the vernacular. One of the consequences 
        of the importation of the Reformation in England was the dissolution of 
        the monasteries. As a result great swathes of land were acquired by the 
        nouveau riche of the merchant class who had become wealthy courtesy of 
        international trade in wool, slaves and coal. They sought to achieve the 
        same levels of profit from their new land by becoming capitalist farmers. 
        This contrasted with the great aristocratic landowner&#8217;s approach 
        which was still in the feudal tradition; consequently they became increasingly 
        concerned about the wealth of their new neighbours and pressed the king 
        to try to curtail their profits, or at the very least give them a share. 
        To achieve this the King claimed monopoly rights on production which he 
        then proceeded to give to aristocratic cronies at his court together with 
        the infamous &#8216;ship tax&#8217; which gave him a share of trading 
        profits. The new &#8216;landed gentry&#8217; (capitalist farmers) together 
        with other progressive elements in society were outraged by this and campaigned 
        through parliament for a &#8216;free market&#8217;. They saw the feudal 
        lands as being unproductive and the aristocracy as a political barrier 
        to their further enrichment. The scene was set for this class struggle 
        to erupt into the English revolution. This is the Marxist or &#8216;materialist&#8217; 
        version of the events of the 1640&#8217;s. Now let us turn to the ideological 
        explanation.<br>
        When Constantine adopted Christianity as the state religion of Rome he 
        attempted to make the diverse legends (gospels) into a coherent ideology 
        that would serve his political needs. Although there continues to be some 
        controversy the gospels we have now in the &#8216;New Testament&#8217; 
        date from that time. The religion has obvious attractions to an autocrat 
        in that it represents the ultimate authoritarian social structure with 
        God at the top and his representatives (the Pope, Emperor, Kings and the 
        priesthood) in a descending coalition of oppression. It also, however, 
        has revolutionary elements in terms of its original defiance of Roman 
        hegemony and the Christ being a messiah or deliverer from tyranny. This 
        is the element taken up by the Puritans who were profoundly dissatisfied 
        with the English Reformation and perceived the Anglican church to be still 
        very &#8216;Papist&#8217; and politically reactionary. This together with 
        the Protestant emphasis on &#8216;hard work&#8217;, obedience, thrift 
        and the idea that worldly wealth and success was an indication of belonging 
        to god&#8217;s &#8216;elect&#8217; made them obvious allies for the emerging 
        bourgeoisie. For hundreds of years the priest in the pulpit had been the 
        major political propagandist for the ruling class so it is not surprising 
        that the political debate in the 17th century centred on Christian doctrine 
        and the perceived importance of controlling the church. As we have seen 
        the pulpit now had a propaganda rival in the printing press and within 
        this revolutionary environment an infinite variety of dissention was expressed. 
        There were some who saw the revolution as a culmination of class antagonisms 
        but the majority understood it in terms of Catholic (the Pope being the 
        &#8216;anti-Christ&#8217;) oppression of their natural (political) rights 
        with Charles I&#8217;s claim to Divine Right being an obvious expression 
        of this. Once the revolutionary war started both sides believed that victory 
        on the battlefield was the sign of divine approval. The central message 
        of the gospels that you should love your fellow man as yourself never 
        represented a serious disincentive to the years of carnage that followed. 
        <br>
        We can be certain that Jesus of Nazareth (if he existed as an historical 
        individual) would be more than a little surprised by the killing that 
        has been done in his name. It is also next to impossible to find any justification 
        for war in the gospels (with the possible exception of the book of revelation 
        which, in contrast to the other texts, seems to be a diatribe of revenge). 
        What Christianity does offer ruling elites, and would be ruling elites, 
        is an authoritarian universe with everything and everyone in his place. 
        Many, if not most, religions offer this reactionary supernatural scenario 
        and it wouldn&#8217;t take much imagination to replace it with any other 
        similar religion and, given the same political and historical context 
        of England in 1642, the result would be the same &#8211; revolution. In 
        other words the ideology that expressed the fears and ambitions of those 
        who made the revolution were relatively unimportant compared with the 
        economic and political forces that compelled them into violent opposition. 
        It may be said that this represents an unprovable hypothesis because you 
        can never impose retrospective ideological alternatives on to history; 
        what we can do, however, is compare this revolution with others that have 
        also transformed their society from monarchical absolutism to bourgeois 
        rule without the aid of Christian ideology. In the second part of this 
        article we attempt to do that with an analysis of the French revolution 
        where not only was Christianity absent within the ideology of the victors 
        it was replaced by a philosophy we call the Enlightenment which possessed 
        an atheist trajectory. </font> </div>

        &amp; Revolution<br>
        Part 2 - The French Revolution<br>
        On the 4th April 1727 a leading French intellectual was present at the 
        state funeral of Sir Isaac Newton in London. His name was Voltaire and 
        what he found most impressive about the grand occasion was that although 
        Newton was born a commoner his work had gained him such prestige as to 
        warrant so high a national honour. Such a thing could never have happened 
        in France at that time where only members of the nobility could hope to 
        provoke such national recognition. This was testament to the complete 
        political domination of the English bourgeoisie who, after their revolution 
        in the 1640&#8217;s, had fought off an attempted counter revolution in 
        1688 and installed a constitutional monarch, an act of religious tolerance, 
        free trade and even a &#8216;bill of rights&#8217;; something of which 
        the French middle class could only dream of. The new English ruling class 
        embraced the symbiotic relationship of science and technology which was 
        soon, through the immanent &#8216;industrial revolution&#8217;, to make 
        them far wealthier than many of the petty European feudal monarchies. 
        Isaac Newton became one of the first icons of the intellectual movement 
        that turned its focus from religious faith to scientific reason in which 
        we now call &#8216;The Enlightenment&#8217;. Newton presented society 
        with a universal natural mechanism that had the potential to explain everything 
        &#8211; including, in the hands of philosophers and political radicals, 
        the perceived intellectual and moral progression of human cultural activity 
        through history. It was to be the French intellectuals who were to transform 
        this radical philosophy into a political ideology with which to fuel their 
        own bourgeois revolution. <br>
        We have seen that it was the protestant Reformation that enabled the English 
        bourgeoisie to intellectually challenge the might of reactionary international 
        Catholicism and which, in turn, informed the ideological propaganda used 
        in their revolutionary struggle with their king. In France the Reformation 
        was only ever partially successful and eventually almost entirely succumbed 
        to the &#8216;counter reformation&#8217;. As a result the capitalist mode 
        of production was continually handicapped by the very same feudal economic 
        relationships that had so frustrated the English middle classes in the 
        first part of the 17th century. This underlying class struggle was simmering 
        and waiting to burst into revolution in France by the mid to late 18th 
        century. As we have seen it was the French intellectual&#8217;s use of 
        Enlightenment philosophy which was to reflect this remorseless economic 
        and political tension. Foremost among these was Dennis Diderot&#8217;s 
        Encyclopaedia which attempted the complete reformulation of knowledge 
        through an enlightenment perspective. Together with writers such as Rousseau 
        and Voltaire they began work on this monumental undertaking which was 
        immediately recognised as a threat to the establishment by those who sought 
        to defend the &#8216;Ancien Regime&#8217;. Another surprising element 
        that served to weaken the paradigms of continental Catholicism came from 
        a most unlikely source. Portugal had always been devout and, like its 
        neighbour Spain, a bastion of reactionary autocracy. In 1755 a mighty 
        earthquake hit its capital Lisbon destroying most of the city including 
        many churches together with their congregations. A reciprocal tsunami 
        augmented the devastation and death toll. Many believed this to be a breach 
        of the covenant with the Christian god and served to seriously weaken 
        belief in traditional religion and the social structures that went with 
        it. All of these uncertainties, new intellectual paradigms and the manifest 
        injustices of feudal autocracy were about to find their political expression 
        as part of the explosion that was the French Revolution.<br>
        It all started, as almost an action replay of the English revolution, 
        when the French king was forced to call a parliament (Estates General) 
        to deal with a financial crisis. France was near bankruptcy as a result, 
        ironically, of Louis XVI&#8217;s helping finance the American republican 
        struggle against England. This parliament was composed of three &#8216;estates&#8217;: 
        nobility, clergy and the commons. Although the deputies of the commons 
        represented over 90% of the French people they only had a third of the 
        votes, the other two thirds belonging to the nobility and clergy. This 
        made it inevitable that they would be out-voted by the other two estates 
        on most issues of contention. Upon being called to Versailles the members 
        of the commons produced a book of grievances which addressed, together 
        with many other problems, this profoundly anti-democratic arrangement. 
        Unsurprisingly the other estates prevaricated and the commons lost patience 
        and proclaimed itself as a National Assembly which represented the entire 
        population of France and on its return to Versailles, some days later, 
        to begin its work the delegates found themselves locked out of their former 
        meeting place. Undeterred they proceeded to the nearest large interior 
        space within the massive palace complex (a tennis court) where they took 
        an oath not to separate until they had produced a political national constitution. 
        Thus began the revolution on the 20th June 1789. Despite a provocative 
        build up of reactionary military forces the Assembly quickly got to work 
        abolishing feudalism and producing a Declaration of the Rights of Man 
        and the Citizen ( again very reminiscent of the English parliament&#8217;s 
        Petition of Right and then it&#8217;s revolutionary &#8216;Grand Remonstrance&#8217; 
        of some 150 years before). In Paris, meanwhile, the decades of oppression 
        of the poor had exploded into violence which culminated in the storming 
        of the Bastille and the subsequent arming of the &#8216;sans culottes&#8217; 
        (proto working class) who were to defend the revolution against both traitors 
        within the country and then to fight the revolutionary wars against the 
        other nations which sought to destroy the new regime. The French bourgeoisie 
        originally, as had the English, wanted a constitutional monarchy rather 
        than a Republic but when Louis, like Charles I, was proven a traitor he 
        had to be executed. By now the Assembly had moved to Paris where it came 
        under the influence of a radical republican group (the Jacobins) and their 
        most prominent member Maximilien Robespierre who, arguably, took the revolution 
        in a direction that the moderate members of the bourgeoisie had never 
        intended and which certainly did not correspond with the values of the 
        Enlightenment.<br>
        These radicals would have been unable to take control of the revolution 
        without the connivance of a series of events; civil war, international 
        war, inflation and sectarian rivalry all contributed to what we now call 
        &#8216;The Terror&#8217; and the reign of Madame La Guillotine. In some 
        ways this goes to prove that the ideology of the enlightenment was, at 
        best, only an idealistic aspiration and, at worst, merely empty propaganda 
        to motivate those who did the fighting. Certainly when Napoleon Bonaparte 
        came to power during a coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat in 1799 and subsequently 
        &#8216;exported&#8217; the revolution to most of continental Europe it 
        was seen eventually for what it really was &#8211; an empire of exploitation 
        and plunder. Oliver Cromwell had preceded Napoleon in this by his violent 
        imperial activities in Ireland and both individuals represented the realities 
        of bourgeois rule, stripped of its high minded rhetoric. Since the days 
        of these capitalist revolutions many millions of workers have continued 
        to kill and be killed in the name of high ideals such as liberty, fraternity 
        and equality. This does not, of course, invalidate these ideals and the 
        integrity of those like Rousseau and Diderot who believed in them but, 
        like the radical Christian ideals of the puritans, they captured the &#8216;zeitgeist&#8217; 
        of their time, and as such, were open to the manipulation by the powerful; 
        and that power, in the end, derived not from ideals but from economic 
        and political forces which were little understood at that time. Both the 
        French and English revolutions had the same result &#8211; the coming 
        to power of the capitalist class despite the use of seemingly opposite 
        ideologies (philosophical reason as opposed to religious faith); dialectically 
        speaking such ideas are taken up because they seem to contain, however 
        vaguely understood, antithetical elements with regard to the prevailing 
        paradigms that rationalise the existing system. Such ideas always find 
        an audience because of the oppression and exploitation necessary to sustain 
        any private property system. These ideas are catapulted into the political 
        spotlight when economic and historical circumstances make revolutionary 
        change inevitable. Socialists, with the invaluable help of Karl Marx, 
        have understood this for over 100 years now but, ironically, this political 
        insight also fell victim to the manipulation of a new ruling class &#8211; 
        namely the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. Does this imply that 
        Marxism/Socialism is merely just another form of idealism that can be 
        manipulated and used as propaganda by power elites? In part three we investigate 
        the relationship between the revolutionary events in Russia in 1917 and 
        the political theory of socialism and what both owed, if anything, to 
        the Enlightenment. </font></div>

        AND REVOLUTION Pt.3<br>
        Russia has always represented an enigma to historians. It is obviously 
        connected to European culture but it is also recognisably very different. 
        The reasons for this have pre-occupied many politicians, historians and 
        economists in the west for centuries; Marx, famously, thought of it as 
        a dangerous bastion of reaction that would confront and oppose the development 
        of socialism. One element of consensus within the many theories that attempt 
        to understand Russia&#8217;s relatively slow economic progress is with 
        reference to the overwhelming scale of the country. Until the 19th century 
        the population was not great enough to serve the needs of both agrarian 
        feudalism and the developing capitalism of the cities and even then a 
        series of military defeats seriously curtailed international trade and 
        the internal market was enfeebled by the population&#8217;s lack of spending 
        power. The retention of serfdom was a mechanism specifically devised by 
        the feudal lords to chain workers to their estates and so prevent them 
        from either drifting off into the vast wilderness to farm for themselves 
        or to go in search of better wages in the cities. Although recognised 
        as a handicap by some of the more progressive elements within the Russian 
        hierarchy, including some of the Czars, economically they could not compete 
        with the industrial might of Britain, America and Germany and so were 
        trapped in the backward economic cycle described above. Many of the powerful 
        aristocrats were well aware that industrialisation would need better educated 
        workers together with a wealthy middle class and feared the potential 
        political consequences of that (the French Revolution being their nightmare 
        scenario). However the remorseless economic evolution was unstoppable 
        and the incompatibility of the anachronistic Czarist autocracy with emerging 
        capitalism became devastatingly obvious with the disaster of the First 
        World War. Of all the great powers Russia was the least equipped to fight 
        such an industrialised conflict and the stage was set for the Russians 
        to make their revolution. <br>
        In 1905 the Russian bourgeoisie entered into a coalition of rebellion 
        which petitioned the Czar for political change but it was ruthlessly crushed 
        and many were killed. In a concession to the mood of the country together 
        with the need to end a nation-wide strike a parliament (Dumas) was promised 
        and then, when it did not do as it was told, promptly shut down by a Czar 
        who, like Charles I of England and Louis XVI of France, could not countenance 
        any challenge to his power of &#8216;divine right&#8217;. In the spring 
        of 1917 the war was going so badly that the Czar was forced to abdicate 
        and the Dumas was again reassembled. Among the political parties present 
        within this parliament were the Russian Social Democratic Party who, like 
        the other members of the &#8216;Second International&#8217; gave lip service 
        to Marxism/Socialism but were, in fact, bourgeois reformists. If they 
        had not tried to continue the war in coalition with liberals and conservatives 
        it is possible that Russia would have followed the traditional path to 
        capitalism. When they made this tragic mistake and the country fell into 
        chaos again the regional councils or &#8216;soviets&#8217; formed during 
        the struggles of 1905 filled the power vacuum. Not unlike the &#8216;communes&#8217; 
        of the sans-culottes during the French Revolution these organisations 
        competed with central government for power. As has been already analysed 
        in depth by this journal last month the Bolsheviks came to power by promising 
        to stop the war and feed the people. They at least managed the former 
        undertaking but at the cost of a military dictatorship together with the 
        nationalisation of the means of production that was to give the state 
        complete power over every aspect of Russian life. At first the new regime 
        embraced the soviets but it was only a matter of time before their power 
        was usurped by the Bolsheviks and they survived in name only. As with 
        the English and French revolutions the result was capitalism, which in 
        the case of Bolshevik Russia became something called state capitalism; 
        from the perspective of the immense majority, it was identical to bourgeois 
        capitalism with reference to their lives of exploitation by, and subjugation 
        to, a small power elite. <br>
        If we look at the ideologies of those competing for power in Russia at 
        that time what do we see? Certainly the liberals and conservatives believed 
        in some of the enlightenment ideals that preceded the French revolution 
        but, ironically, it was Lenin who really admired the Machiavellian tactics 
        of the likes of Robespierre! Lenin&#8217;s obsession with power and leadership 
        was essentially bourgeois as were, to the surprise of Rosa Luxemburg upon 
        meeting him, most of his moral and cultural values. Why was it then that 
        he so doggedly proclaimed himself and his regime as socialist? Perhaps 
        he was so enamoured by the political insights and intellectual rigor of 
        socialism, especially through the works of Karl Marx that he was reluctant 
        to abandon them in the light of Russian political reality even after the 
        non appearance of the anticipated European-wide socialist revolution. 
        He identified himself with socialism to the extent that he was prepared 
        to pervert the concept into its antithesis where Marx&#8217;s joke about 
        &#8216;the dictatorship of the proletariat&#8217; (i.e. democracy) became 
        the excuse for a totalitarian regime rather than admit to the impossibility 
        of creating socialism in one country &#8211; and one that had yet to experience 
        the political consequences of capitalism. The other possibility, of course, 
        is that once he had tasted power he could not give it up and his &#8216;socialism&#8217; 
        served as a justification for this. There is little evidence that many 
        understood slogans like &#8216;all power to the soviets&#8217; as having 
        anything to do with socialism and, as we have seen, many of those who 
        did think of themselves as socialist were primarily reformists who did 
        not believe in revolution. It would seem that yet again the ideologies 
        used were primarily propaganda expedients to manipulate those who could 
        enable the elite&#8217;s rise to power. <br>
        The failure of the Bolshevik regime, the Soviet Union or Communist Russia, 
        call it what you will, to produce anything remotely resembling socialism 
        is testament to the Marxist understanding of how history proceeds. Without 
        the productivity and class consciousness created by industrial capitalism 
        socialism is impossible. That so many of Europe&#8217;s intellectuals 
        were seduced by Bolshevik propaganda underlines their idealism and the 
        political danger inherent in the ignorance of historical materialism. 
        To paraphrase Marx: &#8216;men create history but only within the limitations 
        of their historical context&#8217;. To understand any political activity 
        it is first necessary to comprehend the tectonics of economic evolution 
        and the historical level of the class struggle it has enabled. The historical 
        reality of the English, French and Russian revolutions was the political 
        consolidation of the transition from feudalism to capitalism which no 
        superficial ideological differences can conceal. The subsequent history 
        of these countries is entirely due to the economic and political logic 
        of capitalism and has nothing to do with the ideals of Puritan Christianity, 
        The Enlightenment or Marxism. Socialism will not be ideological in so 
        far as it will resolve the class struggle that has created the need for 
        ideals with which class minorities struggle for intellectual and political 
        supremacy. With its emphasis on reason and its rejection of faith Marxism 
        has its roots within the European Enlightenment but it is the antithesis 
        to the idealism of Voltaire and Rousseau which, in the hands of Robespierre 
        and Napoleon, became excuses for political authoritarianism &#8211; the 
        true essence of all bourgeois ideology. By being conscious of the nature 
        of the class struggle socialists cannot be manipulated by ideology and 
        once they become the immense majority the revolution becomes inevitable 
        as is the dissolution of all political parties, including the socialist 
        party, after its conclusion. Lenin did not live to see the nemesis (Stalin, 
        the gulags, starvation etc.) that his hubris had helped to create for 
        the Russian people, who still await their liberation &#8211; let&#8217;s 
        hope that it&#8217;s not another hundred years before this is accomplished, 
        with their help, by a real global socialist revolution. <br>
