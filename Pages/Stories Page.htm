      <p><font face="Deutsch Gothic"><strong><font size="+2">House of the Damned</font></strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        <font color="#000000">The doorbell buzzed relentlessly, occasionally supplemented 
        by a hammering on the door. He sat motionless in the dark room, staring 
        but not seeing and listening but not hearing. <br>
        &#8216;Giles are you there? Please answer me; it&#8217;s been days&#8217; 
        called a worried female voice from behind his apartment door.<br>
        Finally the buzzing gave way to the sound of the landlord&#8217;s key 
        turning in the lock. The two of them entered the room carefully, uncertain 
        of what to expect. Upon turning on the light they saw Giles Chadderton 
        blinking under the sudden illumination. <br>
        &#8216;There you are, what on earth were you doing, we&#8217;ve been worried 
        sick&#8217; said Paula Laurie.<br>
        He looked up at her: &#8216;Wha - what are you doing here Paula?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Darling, we&#8217;ve been calling you for days, but you didn&#8217;t 
        reply. What have you been up to?&#8217; she said rather waspishly.<br>
        &#8216;I&#8217;ve just been reading, has it been that long?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Reading, you mean to tell me that you&#8217;ve been sat here reading 
        for three days while I&#8217;ve been out of my mind with worry?&#8217; 
        she saw a manuscript on the table in front of him and reached for it.<br>
        &#8216;DON&#8217;T TOUCH THAT&#8217; he shouted fiercely.<br>
        She recoiled; he&#8217;d never raised his voice to her before.<br>
        &#8216;Sorry, darling. I&#8217;ll explain but first I need a drink. Pour 
        me a Scotch would you&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;I&#8217;ll be on my way&#8217; said the landlord, not wanting to 
        get involved in a &#8216;domestic&#8217;<br>
        Paula poured two large Scotches and returned, handing him one. Now her 
        eyes had become accustomed to the light she saw how deathly pale he was. 
        Her anger turned back to concern. He drank thirstily from a shaking hand.<br>
        &#8216;What&#8217;s wrong Giles? I&#8217;ve never seen you like this&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;I&#8217;ve never been like this, I doubt if many have. I suppose 
        it must have all began three days ago. That&#8217;s when I received that, 
        that manuscript. I sensed something unusual about it straight away; it 
        was old, very old and written in a perfect gothic script. But to my astonishment 
        it was a script for a movie! It&#8217;s called &#8216;House of the Damned&#8217; 
        and, as you might guess, it&#8217;s a horror story. There was a letter 
        enclosed with it that read:<br>
        Dear Mr. Chadderton, I enclose this script in the confident hope that 
        we can transform it into a moving picture together. When you have read 
        it I must ask that you show it to no other living person nor divulge its 
        content. I have followed your career and believe your talents are well 
        suited to bring my little story to life on, what those in your trade call, 
        the silver screen. The movies I have seen, although called stories of 
        horror, do not justify that most eloquent of sobriquets; together I think 
        we can correct this sorry state of affairs. Please visit me at your leisure; 
        I&#8217;m always at home, your servant, Count Bellok Von Montescue, The 
        Citadel, California. <br>
        &#8216;Sounds like a crank to me, I mean all that Count something or other 
        crap&#8217; said Paula.<br>
        Giles began to laugh, a strange unnatural laugh.<br>
        &#8216;Oh yes, a crank undoubtedly, but then there&#8217;s the script. 
        I can hardly recall it without trembling with dread. It, it&#8217;s like 
        the writer knows all of your deepest most hidden terrors and then plays 
        with them like a cat with an injured mouse. You don&#8217;t want to read, 
        but you must, you must read more and savour every delicious perverted 
        macabre morsel. My God, it&#8217;s an insult to every moral fibre of my 
        being but it&#8217;s a goddamned masterpiece!&#8217; <br>
        &#8216;No wonder you didn&#8217;t answer your phone, you&#8217;ve been 
        hypnotized by this Count what&#8217;s his name. Please don&#8217;t tell 
        me you&#8217;re considering making his movie?&#8217;<br>
        Giles didn&#8217;t answer; he&#8217;d regained his looking into nothingness 
        pose. She kicked him in the shin and he turned slowly towards her.<br>
        &#8216;Oh yes, I must, you see after I read the first page I knew only 
        I could make it; and it has to be made&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Listen darling, what you need is a shower and a good night&#8217;s 
        sleep. Tomorrow you&#8217;ll feel refreshed and perhaps the damn script 
        will have lost some of its appeal. I know you&#8217;ve been under a lot 
        of pressure recently and...&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;And you think I&#8217;m cracking up. Listen, I know my last two 
        movies were crap, but this script can get me back on top. Nobody has ever 
        made a film like this one. Will you come with me to meet the Count, I 
        can&#8217;t show you the manuscript but perhaps if you meet him you&#8217;ll 
        understand. Will you come with me Paula?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;OK, OK, I&#8217;ll play along, but only if you promise to get 12 
        hours of sleep. Now come on, let&#8217;s get you to bed&#8217;</font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        <strong>Chapter Two</strong><br>
        &#8216;I don&#8217;t mean to cast any doubt on your navigational skills 
        but are we, not to labour the point, lost?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Well that guy at the gas station said that the place isn&#8217;t 
        on the map but if we follow this road we will come to it&#8217; replied 
        Paula curtly.<br>
        &#8216;We&#8217;ve been following this &#8216;road&#8217;, if you can 
        call this dirt track a road, for an hour now and no sign of any habitation. 
        We must be some place between nowhere and gone&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;I remind you that I didn&#8217;t want to come along in the first 
        place &#8211; you and your damned script. It&#8217;s quite alright with 
        me if we turn back, it&#8217;ll be dark soon and then we&#8217;ll really 
        be lost&#8217;<br>
        Just then two mighty masonry gate posts loomed above them. Giles slammed 
        on the brakes and they stopped in front of an imposing cast-iron gate.<br>
        &#8216;Guess this is it. Wow, look at those gargoyles perched up there 
        &#8211; they don&#8217;t look very pleased to see us. There&#8217;s an 
        intercom, we&#8217;d better announce our arrival&#8217;<br>
        Giles reached up through the window and pressed a red button:<br>
        &#8216;Hi, this is Giles Chadderton. I&#8217;d like to speak with Count 
        Montescue &#8211; we have an open invitation&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Good evening Mr. Chadderton, we&#8217;ve been expecting you. Please, 
        drive up to the house but keep your car windows closed and do not get 
        out of your vehicle until you see me approach. I am the Count&#8217;s 
        daughter Irene&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;OK, thanks, we&#8217;re on our way&#8217;<br>
        The gates creaked open and they drove up the twisting gravel driveway 
        &#8211; the head of one of the gargoyles turned to watch their progress. 
        The sun was just setting as they saw the Citadel for the first time. Its 
        granite walls glowed in the dying light; it looked almost alive like some 
        gigantic sleeping beast. They pulled up and a slim female figure emerged 
        from the interior of the beast. Giles began to climb out of his seat. 
        Quite suddenly he was aware of low growling and the movement of a shadow 
        to his left. An enormous black dog ran towards him. He heard the woman 
        call:<br>
        &#8216;Be calm and remain still Mr. Chadderton&#8217;<br>
        He did as he was bidden and the dog sat before him gazing at him with 
        red eyes.<br>
        &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry about Caliban, he&#8217;s very protective and doesn&#8217;t 
        like strangers&#8217;<br>
        She was tall and thin with perfect white skin. There was an ethereal quality 
        about her elegance that made you fear she could break at any moment. <br>
        &#8216;He&#8217;s a monster, what breed is he?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Oh, he&#8217;s the oldest breed there is, he&#8217;s a wolf&#8217; 
        she smiled and held out her hand.<br>
        For a moment he wanted to kiss it but remembered, just in time, that it 
        was 1935 and shook it instead.<br>
        &#8216;A pleasure to meet you ma&#8217;am&#8217; he said nervously, sounding 
        like a hillbilly.<br>
        &#8216;I have been looking forward to your arrival; I&#8217;m a great 
        fan of your work, may I call you Giles?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Yes, of course, may I call you Irene?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;You may, but not in front of my Father &#8211; he&#8217;s a stickler 
        for old time etiquette&#8217;<br>
        There was a loud clearing of the throat from inside the car.<br>
        &#8216;Oh, sorry, this is my fianc&eacute;e, Paula Laurie&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;How do you do, we were not expecting to entertain such a beautiful 
        Lady. Welcome to the Citadel&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Well thank you, are you sure your &#8216;wolf&#8217; there won&#8217;t 
        be wanting to entertain me?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Leave us Caliban&#8217; she ordered and it ran back into the shadows.<br>
        They followed her into the house. The hallway was cavernous with flickering 
        candlelight that gave the shadows of the many statues a restless animation. 
        An ornate stairway disappeared up into utter darkness; Giles could not 
        help shuddering as he looked upon the lofty interior &#8211; it was just 
        as described in the manuscript.<br>
        &#8216;My father will join us in a moment, please go through&#8217;<br>
        Paula let out a long slow whistle when their host disappeared.<br>
        &#8216;This Count of yours must be worth a mint, just look at this place&#8217; 
        she said with undisguised admiration.<br>
        &#8216;It&#8217;s strange I&#8217;ve never heard of it. It&#8217;s like 
        a piece of old Europe transported into the middle of 20th century California. 
        I hope the Count doesn&#8217;t look and speak like Bela Lugosi, it would 
        be difficult not to laugh&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Lugosi is a peasant pretending to be an aristocrat; I however, 
        need no such pretence&#8217;<br>
        They turned to see a very tall distinguished looking man in his fifties.<br>
        &#8216;Oh, I do beg your pardon, Count Montescue?&#8217; said Giles, in 
        embarrassment.<br>
        &#8216;Do not worry my young friend, I am not easily offended. This is 
        your lovely companion Miss Laurie I believe&#8217;<br>
        He advanced toward her and kissed her hand. Paula was impressed again.<br>
        &#8216;Can we offer you a drink? I have a good vintage brandy opened&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Thank you Count, that would be most welcome&#8217;<br>
        Irene reappeared and served the drinks. They sat in the splendour of a 
        large room with bookcases lining the walls. The Count noticed Giles looking 
        at them.<br>
        &#8216;Are you interested in the Esoteric? Most of the volumes you see 
        here are concerned with what some would call &#8216;the dark arts&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;I&#8217;ve never really had the opportunity to study it but I love 
        old books&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Some of these are centuries old - my family inheritance, you might 
        say&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Are you a magician?&#8217; asked Paula bluntly.<br>
        The Count smiled: &#8216;I dabble occasionally. I see by your expression 
        that you are not a believer&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Oh, I only believe in what I can see and touch&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;How charmingly naive of you my dear. Perhaps you would allow me 
        a demonstration?&#8217;<br>
        Without waiting for her consent he clicked his fingers and an enormous 
        black panther sauntered into the room. Giles and Paula caught their breath 
        in fear.<br>
        &#8216;Don&#8217;t be afraid, he&#8217;s perfectly house trained&#8217; 
        <br>
        A waltz started to play and to their utter amazement the panther got up 
        onto its hind legs and danced with Irene. They whirled around the room, 
        gathering speed until they seemed a blur of movement. It was an unnatural 
        spectacle that was both intriguing and terrifying. They began to slow 
        and the Panther turned its great head and said to Paula: &#8216;May I 
        have the next dance?&#8217;<br>
        Paula screamed and fell off her chair. At that moment the Count clicked 
        his fingers again and they saw before them Irene lovingly stroking a black 
        cat in her arms.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        <strong>Chapter Three</strong><br>
        &#8216;I really don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re so upset. You must admit 
        that you rather taunted our host with your dismissal of his interest in 
        magic&#8217;<br>
        They were dressing for dinner and Paula was both angry and a little scared.<br>
        &#8216;I might have guessed that you&#8217;d take his part. He really 
        frightened me with that little parlour trick of his and now you&#8217;re 
        saying it&#8217;s my own fault?&#8217; she replied.<br>
        &#8216;You must admit it was rather impressive. Surely you were a little 
        impressed by his skill at illusion?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;That&#8217;s the point, it didn&#8217;t feel like an illusion to 
        me&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;So are you saying he&#8217;s a real wizard with occult powers?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Of course not, but he had no right to scare us stupid. Didn&#8217;t 
        it feel real to you?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;It would hardly be worthy as an illusion if it didn&#8217;t feel 
        real, would it? Anyway let&#8217;s have a good dinner and discuss some 
        business &#8211; I want to nail the rights to his script before the night 
        is out&#8217;<br>
        They walked down into the impressive dining hall where servants attended 
        them studiously in the company of the Count and his daughter. After a 
        sumptuous meal they settled down to conversation over the brandy.<br>
        &#8216;I hope I didn&#8217;t frighten you with my little illusion earlier. 
        It&#8217;s always so tempting to surprise a disbeliever and I apologise 
        for enjoying your distress as much as I did. Will you forgive me young 
        lady?&#8217; asked the Count.<br>
        &#8216;After such a feast it would be most ungrateful of me to be churlish 
        about it. I don&#8217;t suppose you would care to tell us how you did 
        it?&#8217; replied Paula.<br>
        &#8216;Your supposition is correct &#8211; a necromancer can never reveal 
        the source of his powers. I hope it impressed your intended so that I 
        might play the leading role in our film?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;We&#8217;ll have to do a screen test, but I would anticipate that 
        you will be very &#8216;cinematic&#8217;. Have you acted before?&#8217; 
        answered a surprised Giles.<br>
        &#8216;I have some theatrical experience&#8217; said the Count with a 
        wicked smile.<br>
        &#8216;Will you be my co-star?&#8217; he said, turning to Paula.<br>
        &#8216;Oh, I really don&#8217;t know &#8211; I haven&#8217;t been allowed 
        to read the script&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;That&#8217;s good; your reactions will be all the more authentic. 
        What do you think Giles?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;It&#8217;s certainly an intriguing idea. To film in sequence as 
        the story unfolds without the main protagonist knowing what to expect. 
        However the story is rather, how should I say, rather frightening and 
        I don&#8217;t know if Paula would be up to it&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Listen, my love, I&#8217;ve made many more films than you have 
        and I&#8217;ve never been accused of &#8216;not being up to it&#8217; 
        in any of them. Bring on your ghosts and monsters Count Montescue, they 
        don&#8217;t scare a girl from the Bronx&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Bravo, Miss Laurie, I knew you were a girl with spirit as soon 
        as I saw you&#8217; beamed the Count.<br>
        &#8216;When I get back I&#8217;ll arrange the finances and the crew&#8217; 
        said Giles.<br>
        &#8216;Oh, no need, I have already purchased the cameras and film stock. 
        We will be joined by some of my countrymen who will provide the crew. 
        We can begin as soon as you wish&#8217; replied the Count.<br>
        Giles was dumbfounded:<br>
        &#8216;You mean you want us to start immediately?&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Certainly - Why wait? You can use my telephone to contact those 
        who need to know where you are&#8217;<br>
        After a few more brandies Giles consented to making a start &#8211; provided 
        he could make some changes to the script that he had in mind. The conversation 
        turned to a consideration of the nature of evil. The Count insisted that 
        everyone was capable of evil acts in the right circumstances. Paula would 
        have none of it and made a spirited defence of mankind&#8217;s innate 
        goodness.<br>
        &#8216;Well what do you think Giles? Have you ever committed an act of 
        evil?&#8217; asked the Count.<br>
        &#8216;When I was a child of eight or nine my sister acquired a puppy 
        whom she loved dearly. I became jealous of the little beast because she 
        seemed to love it more than me. One day I found myself alone with the 
        dog and while I wasn&#8217;t looking it fell into our fish pond. Its legs 
        became entangled in some weeds and it barked pitifully for my help. I 
        just sat there and let it drown. I waited to make sure it was dead and 
        carried it back to the house. My sister was heartbroken but I was there 
        to console her&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;How could you?&#8217; cried Laura<br>
        Giles did not respond and looked into an unseen distance of time, just 
        as he had done when she discovered him in his apartment.<br>
        &#8216;Remember my dear, he was only a child. Some of the cruelest acts 
        are committed in the name of love&#8217; said the Count in the defence 
        of Giles.<br>
        &#8216;That&#8217;s not love, that&#8217;s jealousy&#8217; she responded.<br>
        &#8216;Again, if I may say so, you have a naive view in such matters. 
        Consider the love of money and power &#8211; are these not evil things? 
        And the hatred of cruelty and injustice &#8211; are these not positive 
        emotions? Love and hate and good and evil are two sides of the same coins 
        and cannot exist without each other. If Giles had not loved his sister 
        he could not have hated the puppy. Evil exists because love does&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;I cannot argue with you &#8211; you have answers to questions I 
        didn&#8217;t know existed. But if you&#8217;re saying that good cannot 
        exist without evil then I have to believe that you must be wrong&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;Aah, that&#8217;s interesting as it will be one of the themes of 
        our film &#8211; whether naivety and innocence create evil. The road to 
        hell being paved with good intentions and all that&#8217; smiled the Count.<br>
        They noticed that Giles was falling asleep. <br>
        &#8216;I think your beloved needs his bed. Perhaps we should retire. Thank 
        you for a most entertaining evening&#8217;<br>
        They were climbing the staircase when the Count shouted up to them:<br>
        &#8216;I should advise you not to venture out of your rooms during the 
        night. When I had this house transplanted from the old country it was 
        not only bricks and mortar that came to this new world of yours&#8217;<br>
        &#8216;I&#8217;ll say one thing for you Count, you never step out of character&#8217; 
        Paula shouted back.<br>

          &#8216;That&#8217;s one tasty beverage&#8217; said Jeremiel who then 
          proceeded to belch loudly.<br>
          &#8216;What precisely is the part of the phrase &#8216;low profile&#8217; 
          that you don&#8217;t understand my young friend?&#8217; asked his formidable 
          companion at the bar.<br>
          &#8216;Sorry, as you know this is my first time here and it&#8217;s 
          all so vivid and exciting, anyway you can talk&#8217; he turned and 
          gestured with a wide sweep of his arm at the female inhabitants of the 
          bar whose eyes were all unblinkingly focused on Michael. <br>
          &#8216;Remind me again why you&#8217;re here?&#8217; shrugged Michael.<br>
          &#8216;I&#8217;m your apprentice. Even you must be getting jaded after, 
          what is it, 5,000 years?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Another one of &#8216;The Boss&#8217;s&#8217; great ideas I suppose&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Oh yes, he thinks it&#8217;s time for some new blood&#8217; chirped 
          Jerry &#8216;Do you think it&#8217;s really possible that your old colleague 
          will enter this realm after all these millennia?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Well the Boss obviously thinks so and time means nothing to &#8216;my 
          old colleague&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Surely if a portal had been opened we could detect it and destroy 
          it?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;This is a very powerful wizard we&#8217;re dealing with and he 
          has the ability to disguise the exact location of the Hellmouth. Don&#8217;t 
          quote me but I think the Boss is a bit frightened&#8217;<br>
          Jerry was wide eyed with incredulity and was about to express this when 
          a man in a fedora walked up to Michael:<br>
          &#8216;I don&#8217;t like the way you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; at my girlfriend 
          and I don&#8217;t like your loud friend&#8217;s manners either&#8217; 
          he said.<br>
          &#8216;Wow, are you a gangster?&#8217; asked Jerry with delight &#8216;I 
          love the roaring thirties&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;It&#8217;s the Roaring Twenties you idiot&#8217; sighed Michael.<br>
          &#8216;But it&#8217;s 1935&#8217; replied Jerry.<br>
          &#8216;I know but the phrase roaring is used for the twenties not the 
          thirties. Sorry about this, you just can&#8217;t get good apprentices 
          these days&#8217; apologised Michael to the man in his face.<br>
          The bewildered belligerent swung at Michael&#8217;s jaw and upon connecting, 
          howled with pain. Jerry asked Michael: &#8216;Can I?&#8217; as he formed 
          a fist.<br>
          Michael sighed again and then all hell broke loose at the bar.</font></p>

          you know what they&#8217;re saying in the village?&#8217; asked Cerise.<br>
          &#8216;What are they saying in the village my little countess?&#8217; 
          replied the Count.<br>
          &#8216;They say that you&#8217;re a magician who has bewitched me and 
          taken me to his castle&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;As usual they are mistaken for it is you who have bewitched me&#8217;<br>
          She giggled as he took her in an embrace and kissed her passionately.<br>
          &#8216;But you are a magician aren&#8217;t you? What do you do in that 
          library of yours all day?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;I know I&#8217;ve neglected my young bride but that will change 
          now. I have a surprise for you&#8217; the Count looked serious.<br>
          &#8216;Oh, I adore surprises&#8217; she said uncertainly.</font><br>
          <font color="#000000">&#8216;We&#8217;re moving to the new world. No 
          more prattling superstitious peasants or cold wintry days. How does 
          California sound?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Really, we&#8217;re really going to Hollywood?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Yes my darling. I&#8217;ve discovered something of great esoteric 
          interest and I&#8217;ve had my other house transported and built there. 
          We can set sail next month&#8217;<br>
          Cerise was ecstatic and screamed with delight. The Count turned from 
          her and accidently looked straight into the camera.<br>
          &#8216;Cut, cut. Never, ever look into the camera my dear Count&#8217; 
          said Giles with a hint of exasperation. <br>
          &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry Giles, it won&#8217;t happen again&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;It was going so well, I was quite jealous of that kiss you gave 
          my fianc&eacute;e&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;I must admit that kissing Paula does not represent a challenge 
          to my acting skills, especially in that gown&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;It is a beautiful dress, where did you find it Count?&#8217; 
          asked Paula.<br>
          &#8216;It belonged to my wife, the Countess Von Montescue&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;You mean the woman who...&#8217; Giles was cut short by the Count 
          raising his finger to his lips.<br>
          Paula was intrigued: &#8216;You boys and your secrets. Can I ask what 
          happened to her?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;You will meet her as the story unfolds&#8217; smiled the Count 
          mischievously. <br>
          &#8216;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;d assumed she was, er, well, dead&#8217; 
          stuttered Paula.<br>
          The Count looked thoughtful and lit a cigar.<br>
          &#8216;Perhaps you should meet her now, it may be too much of a surprise 
          for you during filming. What do you think Giles?&#8217;<br>
          Giles rubbed his chin: &#8216;I must admit that I&#8217;m very curious 
          to meet her myself&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Very well, follow me&#8217;<br>
          They climbed the great staircase and walked the landing with intense 
          anticipation. The Count produced a key and turned it in the lock of 
          one of the bedroom doors. It opened with a creak and they caught their 
          breath as an icy exhalation of air exited the room. A candelabra beside 
          the bed illuminated what looked like a body under the bed clothes. As 
          they advanced they saw the face of a beautiful woman in her late twenties 
          who looked as if she were sleeping. Paula was shivering because of something 
          other than the cold. The Count&#8217;s face looked menacing in the flickering 
          candle light.<br>
          &#8216;May I introduce my wife, the Countess Von Montescue&#8217; he 
          said.<br>
          Paula looked at Giles.<br>
          &#8216;Is she asleep? Why is it so cold in here?&#8217; she asked.<br>
          &#8216;My wife has been dead for nearly thirty years now. We keep the 
          temperature low as it keeps the insects from attacking her&#8217;<br>
          Paula was speechless.<br>
          &#8216;Don&#8217;t look so shocked my young co-star, the Countess will 
          soon rise from her slumber &#8211; with your help&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;But she looks as if she&#8217;s sleeping, she can&#8217;t have 
          been dead for thirty years &#8211; is this another of your illusions 
          Count?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;It is of my doing but it is no illusion. I&#8217;ve kept her 
          in suspended animation using ancient Egyptian incantations so that she 
          may rise again&#8217;<br>
          Paula was trembling visibly now.<br>
          &#8216;OK Count you&#8217;ve had your fun. Paula this is an automaton 
          that we will be using in the film. Come and look&#8217; said Giles beckoning 
          her to the bedside.<br>
          She advanced hesitatingly. It was amazing, the Countess looked so real. 
          The chest heaved gently under the bedclothes and her eyelashes trembled. 
          Paula leaned in for a closer look and suddenly the Countess&#8217; eyes 
          snapped open. The two screamed in unison as the Count once again convulsed 
          with laughter.</font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          <strong>Chapter Five</strong><br>
          Paula sat in her room thoughtfully smoking one of the count&#8217;s 
          black cigarettes. Every instinct told her to get the hell out of this 
          damn house - and so she would have if it hadn&#8217;t been for Giles. 
          She remembered why she loved him as he moved confidently around the 
          set directing the film. He was alive and empowered by his vision, a 
          burning talent focused and creative. She could not walk away now &#8211; 
          it would destroy him. She knew he was weak as a man but, like so many 
          women, she thought she could change him. That was no &#8216;automaton&#8217; 
          and she knew that Giles knew that. But what the hell was it? Suddenly 
          she became aware of a scratching noise on her bedroom door. It wasn&#8217;t 
          Giles as she could hear him gently snoring in the next room. She approached 
          the door slowly. The scratching grew more insistent as she put her ear 
          to the door panel. Then it stopped. After a moment Paula slowly opened 
          her door. The landing was empty and silent. She was about to retreat 
          back inside her room when a fleeting shadow caught her eye. The scratching 
          sound resumed from a dark corner and as she peered into the gloom her 
          heart missed a beat as she saw two eyes looking at her. <br>
          &#8216;Who&#8217;s there?&#8217; she asked.<br>
          The silence was deafening. All she could hear was her heart beating. 
          The eyes blinked and moved upwards to the ceiling. Paula stepped backwards 
          and was about to slam her door behind her when the shadow flew past 
          her and into the room. The momentum of the door slammed it shut. She 
          desperately wrenched at the doorknob to get out but the door was stuck 
          tight. Then she saw it. Like a hobgoblin from a fairy story it crouched 
          on her bed, its batwings quivering. Large fish like eyes stared at her 
          as the mouth salivated grotesquely. She screamed. It seemed startled 
          by her cry and showed its yellow pointed teeth in a horrible grimace. 
          Slowly she moved towards the window. She had to get away from this thing 
          somehow. Suddenly it flew at her and in her panic she tripped and fell. 
          Her eyes looked at the ceiling, she daren&#8217;t turn her head. Where 
          was it? Then she felt a weight gradually pulling itself onto her stomach. 
          Looking down she saw it beginning to climb over her breasts, a large 
          bright pink tongue licking her. Again she screamed. The thing hissed 
          and brought its teeth up towards her face. Its smell was pungent and 
          she turned her head away expecting to feel a vicious bite in the next 
          instant. Instead she heard a woman&#8217;s voice speaking words she 
          did not comprehend. It was Irene&#8217;s voice. The beast snarled and 
          reluctantly retreated. After a few more words it began to whimper and 
          finally fled from the room. <br>
          &#8216;Are you alright Paula?&#8217; enquired Irene as she helped her 
          guest up from the floor. <br>
          &#8216;No I&#8217;m not alright, what the devil was that thing?&#8217; 
          replied an angry Paula.<br>
          Irene led her to the bed to sit and handed her a glass of water. She 
          sat on the chair opposite and looked into Paula&#8217;s eyes.<br>
          &#8216;Take a few deep breaths; you&#8217;ve had a nasty shock. You 
          were warned not to leave your room at night. Now are you sure you want 
          me to tell you what that was?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;What do you mean? Of course I want to know what that thing was&#8217;.<br>
          &#8216;Well then, when you&#8217;re ready we&#8217;ll go for a little 
          walk&#8217;<br>
          A short while later a still shaken Paula followed the slim form of Irene 
          down the staircase and then towards the back of the great house. Through 
          a kitchen they descended another staircase down into a large cellar. 
          The wine racks seemed to go on forever until they approached a great 
          door with ornate hinges.<br>
          &#8216;Once I open this door there can be no going back. What lies behind 
          it will change your life forever&#8217; said Irene with extreme candour.</font></p>

          Michael and Jerry sat in a jail cell awaiting their appearance before 
          the local judge.<br>
          &#8216;Did you see how I despatched that gangster with a single blow 
          &#8211; he went down hard&#8217; smiled Jerry.<br>
          &#8216;Yes my young friend, I saw and now the whole Town will be talking 
          about what happened. How, may I ask, does it help with our mission?&#8217; 
          inquired Michael.<br>
          &#8216;Well we just leave and continue our search. Let&#8217;s go&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;So we break jail and are then the subject of a police search. 
          No one will talk to us about unusual occurrences in the area because 
          we have become the unusual occurrence&#8217; <br>
          &#8216;Okay, I&#8217;m sorry, but you have to admit it was fun&#8217; 
          pleaded Jerry.<br>
          &#8216;You can tell the Boss we failed because we were too busy having 
          fun. Why hasn&#8217;t anybody noticed something, we now know the house 
          must be in this area &#8211; and the Citadel is too massive to go unseen&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;You wanna know about the Citadel young man?&#8217;<br>
          They turned to see a crumpled dirty raincoat lying on the bunk in the 
          cell opposite.<br>
          &#8216;You know of the Citadel?&#8217; called an astonished Michael.<br>
          &#8216;Sure, I watched that monstrosity being built. Took &#8216;em 
          six months. All foreigners jabbering on in their stupid language; but 
          they kept saying the word Citadel so I figured that must be what it&#8217;s 
          called&#8217; said the old tramp turning towards them.<br>
          &#8216;Where was this? Is it far from here?&#8217; asked Michael.<br>
          &#8216;That&#8217;d be telling. What&#8217;s in it fer me?&#8217;<br>
          Michael stood up and crushed the lock of his cell like it was made of 
          paper. He walked over to the old man&#8217;s cell and did the same to 
          it. The tramp backed up against the wall.<br>
          &#8216;Hey mister, I ain&#8217;t lookin&#8217; fer no trouble. Leave 
          me be&#8217; croaked the old man.<br>
          &#8216;We need to know where this house is, it is of great importance 
          to your world&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;I ain&#8217;t got no world, I spit on the world, what do yer 
          think about that?&#8217; said the tramp defiantly.<br>
          Suddenly Michael&#8217;s jacket was torn asunder as he revealed his 
          mighty wings and grabbing the man by his collar he said:<br>
          &#8216;I command you, in the name of the Almighty, to tell me what I 
          must know. If you do not I will throw you into the pit where you may 
          learn of a world of infinite agony and despair. Speak mortal, or die 
          a thousand terrible deaths every day for eternity&#8217; </font></p>

          <strong>Chapter Six</strong><br>
          The groan of the heavy door revealed a darkened room with a faint greenish 
          glow at the far end. Paula followed her guide into the interior. Irene 
          lit a torch that hung on the wall. Before them was a circular chasm, 
          about twelve feet in diameter surrounded by runic symbols written in 
          chalk. A green mist arose from it and Paula could see the surface of 
          a glowing liquid that pulsated and churned.<br>
          &#8216;What on earth is this?&#8217; she asked <br>
          &#8216;A Hellmouth&#8217; said Irene in a matter-of-fact voice.<br>
          &#8216;Another of the Count&#8217;s illusions?&#8217; said Paula.<br>
          &#8216;You have not experienced any illusions since your arrival &#8211; 
          this least of all&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;So you&#8217;re going to tell me that this is really a doorway 
          to hell?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;You asked me the nature of the thing that attacked you. It was 
          a demon from hell. My father&#8217;s enchantments keep most of them 
          at bay but as the moment draws near there can be no stopping them all&#8217; 
          explained Irene patiently.<br>
          &#8216;What moment draws near?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;My father had the house erected on top of this portal as soon 
          as he discovered its existence here in your new world. He had been looking 
          for one for centuries and then you experienced a minor earthquake here 
          and the Hellmouth was revealed to him&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;What do you mean by centuries? The Count is fifty years old if 
          he&#8217;s a day&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Count Bellok von Montescue is 243 years old. The discovery of 
          the elixir of life was his greatest achievement until now&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;I want to disbelieve you but I can&#8217;t. I knew those weren&#8217;t 
          illusions. That was really the Countess wasn&#8217;t it?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Yes, my mother awaits her resurrection&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;That&#8217;s blasphemy, only God can perform such a miracle&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;There is another. My father will raise the Dark Lord Satan himself 
          from this portal and the dead will rise again&#8217;<br>
          Paula held her head in her hands: &#8216;No, that must not be. Why did 
          you invite us here?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;I&#8217;m not entirely sure, but just think of it; you will film 
          the beginning of a new world. The true face of Lucifer himself will 
          be revealed to the world for the first time. My father&#8217;s genius 
          will echo down the centuries together with that of your beloved Giles&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Giles would never do that&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;My dear he will do anything to make a great movie. He thinks 
          he&#8217;s making a drama but in fact he&#8217;ll make the greatest 
          documentary of all time&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Why are you telling me all this, you know I will never play a 
          part in such infamy. I will tell Giles everything and we will leave 
          this godforsaken place&#8217; said Paula tearfully.<br>
          &#8216;You know that to be untrue, Giles will never leave and if you 
          tell him the truth it will, if he believes you, inspire him even more. 
          My father and Giles are very similar; both are obsessives who will let 
          nothing get in the way of what they want. I think that&#8217;s why he 
          was chosen&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;But what of you Irene, surely you can see that what you are helping 
          your father do is an act of irredeemable evil?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;You are just spouting the Christian propaganda of your masters. 
          The Dark Lord will liberate you from your enslavement and you will rise 
          from your knees to create a new world. Join us Paula and sit at Satan&#8217;s 
          table and enjoy the fruits of this world without the cringing guilt 
          of Christianity gnawing at your soul&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Never, you&#8217;re as mad as your father&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Do as you will then but remember it will happen whatever you 
          think of it. You can go and hide in your room or take your place with 
          Giles and make the greatest film in history&#8217;<br>

          <strong>Chapter Seven</strong><br>
          &#8216;I wish you hadn&#8217;t told my lovely co-star the true nature 
          of our purpose here. Are you positive she believed you?&#8217; asked 
          the Count of his daughter.<br>
          &#8216;The Hellmouth is quite convincing, not to mention her little 
          visitor. She already knew that what she has seen were no mere illusions, 
          I only confirmed what she suspected.&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Never-the-less it&#8217;s not what I had planned. You took too 
          much upon yourself Irene&#8217; replied the Count rather scornfully.<br>
          &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry father. She did ask me a question that has bothered 
          me&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;And what was that?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Why are they here? I&#8217;ve never understood why you need them 
          to make a film of our Master&#8217;s accession &#8211; at least not 
          some kind of superficial Hollywood horror flick&#8217;<br>
          There was a silence as the Count gazed out upon the dark wood beyond 
          the house. <br>
          &#8216;It&#8217;s not why &#8216;they&#8217; are here, it&#8217;s why 
          &#8216;she&#8217; is here&#8217; replied the Count enigmatically.<br>
          &#8216;I don&#8217;t understand you father&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;You have no idea who she is, do you? I&#8217;ve searched for 
          her for decades, ever since the time I discovered how to bring forth 
          the Dark Lord. And of all the places to find her and the Hellmouth in 
          the same location and at the same time &#8211; in California! It can 
          only be a manifestation of a malign destiny within which we are just 
          a part. My power alone could not bring forth a new beginning, I myself 
          was brought forth to serve a greater revelation; mankind&#8217;s true 
          destiny&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;But who is she?&#8217; pleaded Irene.<br>
          &#8216;She is perfection. Without sin she is incapable of conceiving 
          of the malign, of the immoral, of the hateful. While she lives our Lord 
          cannot enter this realm. She is here so that she may die&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Paula is to be sacrificed?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;As part of the sacraments for our lord Lucifer&#8217;s accession 
          the soul of one without sin must be given up willingly. She is so in 
          love with that fool Giles that she will do anything to save him. I knew 
          if I offered him the script he would cast her in the film - now I have 
          her and there will be a record of His coming&#8217;<br>
          Is there no other way? I have grown fond of Paula&#8217; said Irene 
          with a sad resignation.<br>
          &#8216;Of course you have, that&#8217;s the subversive power of the 
          good. They make us love them so we remain in bondage to their God of 
          weakness and supine morality. Destroying her will prove our dedication 
          to the Dark Lord and I will have my wife back and you your mother&#8217;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          ******************************************************<br>
          <br>
          &#8216;So all of this was in the script?&#8217; asked Paula.<br>
          &#8216;Everything you&#8217;ve just told me is in the damn script. The 
          Hellmouth from where Satan will emerge, everything. It amazes me that 
          they&#8217;ve managed to convince you that it&#8217;s all real &#8211; 
          you&#8217;re supposed to be a sceptic aren&#8217;t you?&#8217; replied 
          Giles.<br>
          &#8216;You fool, that&#8217;s just what Irene told me you&#8217;d say. 
          It&#8217;s all a cover for something very real and we cannot and must 
          not be involved in it, for the sake of our very souls&#8217;<br>
          Giles couldn&#8217;t help laughing: &#8216;Listen to yourself; I reckon 
          this old house has really got to you my love. We can&#8217;t stop now 
          &#8211; the climactic scene will be shot tomorrow and I can&#8217;t 
          wait to see how the Count is going to create Lucifer himself. It&#8217;s 
          going to be a hoot!&#8217;<br>
          Paula shook her head in defeat. Irene was right, there was no stopping 
          Giles now and she would have to be at his side, whatever happened. A 
          black dread eclipsed her beautiful soul as a tear meandered its way 
          down her cheek. Giles saw this and embraced her passionately.<br>
          &#8216;Just one more day and then we&#8217;ll be done with the Count 
          and his spooky house. Then all we&#8217;ll have to do is wait for the 
          box office to finance our life of ease and fame. We&#8217;ll be the 
          toast of Hollywood again&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;And Satan offered him the world and all that was in it as his 
          last temptation&#8217; thought Paula, her heart breaking.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          <strong>Chapter Eight</strong><br>
          The day of Ascension dawned, or rather, it failed to dawn as a twilight 
          hung over the usually sunny California. The weather forecasters were 
          at a loss to explain it and it was left to the religiously minded to 
          pronounce its meaning with their usual emphasis on retribution and Armageddon 
          which, on this occasion, was unusually astute. <br>
          &#8216;It&#8217;s just as well we&#8217;ve completed all of the exterior 
          filming &#8211; this light is appalling, I&#8217;ve never seen anything 
          like it&#8217; said Giles peering up at the sky.<br>
          &#8216;Perhaps we&#8217;ll never see the sun again&#8217; responded 
          Irene.<br>
          &#8216;What&#8217;s the matter with the women in this film, first Paula 
          and now you?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;I&#8217;m just sad that this will be the last day of filming. 
          I will miss you and Paula&#8217; said Irene ruefully.<br>
          &#8216;Surely the Count will let you come to the premier and then we 
          can all celebrate together&#8217;<br>
          Irene turned her head and said nothing.<br>
          &#8216;I give up, what&#8217;s got into you two?&#8217; asked Giles.<br>
          Just then the Count appeared.<br>
          &#8216;So, are you ready for the great climax to our little masterpiece 
          young Mr. Chadderton?&#8217; he asked.<br>
          &#8216;You betcha, I can&#8217;t wait to see your final climatic illusion. 
          Will He have horns and batwings?&#8217; enquired a smiling Giles.<br>
          &#8216;My dear young friend this is a work of art, not a fairground 
          attraction. Our Lord will appear as he sees fit and, I suspect, he will 
          embrace a contemporary aspect&#8217;<br>
          Giles was a little disappointed but he knew that the Count was right. 
          The film was more &#8216;art-house&#8217; than Hollywood and the depiction 
          of Satan would have to be as sophisticated as the other elements and 
          characters. They returned to the film set deep in the great house&#8217;s 
          cellar and after the initial technical hubbub had died down a hush fell 
          over the set. All eyes focused on Giles.<br>
          &#8216;And Action!&#8217; he said<br>
          Paula, in her role as Cirice, was dragged to a wooden post and chained 
          to it. Her eyes were wide with fear as she looked about her. Giles was 
          impressed by her intensity and almost felt nervous on her behalf. The 
          Count stepped forward, dressed as a priest of Satan and began his incantation:<br>
          &#8216;We, your servants, humbly beseech you, our Lord Lucifer, to grace 
          us with your presence. Let your reign begin here and now. We bring you 
          a sacrifice of pure blood so that mankind&#8217;s weakness is washed 
          away before you&#8217;<br>
          He turned as Irene brought in a large dagger on a scarlet cushion. The 
          Count took it and raised it high above Cirice&#8217;s breast. She screamed 
          with unearthly terror as it plunged into her. She called out:<br>
          &#8216;Giles, don&#8217;t let them...&#8217;<br>
          Giles was so caught up in what he considered to be her amazing acting 
          that he didn&#8217;t initially realize that what she had shouted was 
          not in the script. <br>
          &#8216;Cut, cut&#8217; he shouted upon the realisation.<br>
          The Count turned to him, the dagger dripping with blood, and said:<br>
          &#8216;Keep those cameras rolling. His Majesty is here!&#8217;<br>
          Everyone turned to the Hellmouth from which began to emerge unspeakable 
          creatures, crawling and scuttling around the floor. <br>
          Giles wasn&#8217;t looking at them; all he could see was Paula&#8217;s 
          limp body hanging in her chains. A terrible fear was growing inside 
          him.<br>
          &#8216;My God, what have I done&#8217; he thought.<br>
          Two naked women with horribly twisted bodies emerged and prostrated 
          themselves on the edge of the portal. Then they saw him. He stepped 
          out onto the bodies of the women and stretched his limbs like someone 
          who had just awoken from a long sleep. He was stocky and unnaturally 
          tall with ghastly white skin. The buttons on his black military style 
          uniform glistened under the flood lights. The Count approached him and 
          knelt down:<br>
          &#8216;Welcome my Lord. I have awaited this moment for many years&#8217;<br>
          The Beast looked down upon him:<br>
          &#8216;You have done well my servant. I too have longed for an eternity 
          to return to my kingdom. And now at last mankind has realized his potential. 
          My followers are legion and soon we will fight the last battle. With 
          her gone, nothing can stop me&#8217;<br>
          He turned to look at the body of Paula and as he did so a shudder went 
          down his massive body.<br>
          Giles was shaking with a heart broken fury:<br>
          &#8216;You murdered my Paula, you bastards, you murdered her&#8217;<br>
          He leapt on the Count and grasped him by the throat. The Count casually 
          plunged the dagger into Giles&#8217; back. Slumping to the ground Giles 
          looked up into the Count&#8217;s black eyes and said weakly:<br>
          &#8216;You tricked me; this is all real isn&#8217;t it?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Of course it is, you young fool. You are just as responsible 
          for her death as am I. Your blind ambition brought her here and you 
          were deaf to the pleas of the one you loved. And what a one, a woman 
          without sin, a saint, here in Babylon&#8217; he laughed.<br>
          Giles turned away and started to crawl towards Paula&#8217;s body. Satan 
          laughed as he died, just inches away from grasping her hand. At that 
          moment the cellar door burst open and they turned to see two angels 
          silhouetted in the opening.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          <strong>Chapter Nine</strong><br>
          Lucifer casually turned to face the uninvited guests:<br>
          &#8216;I see you&#8217;ve come to welcome me home, brother. I don&#8217;t 
          recognize your young companion, perhaps you can introduce me?&#8217;<br>
          Michael looked contemptuously at The Fallen Angel:<br>
          &#8216;Jeremiel, meet the Evil One, the most damned of all creatures. 
          You should return to your pit voluntarily before I have to force you 
          to&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Unlike yourself I&#8217;ve been invited, not only by the Count 
          here but by your beloved mankind. They&#8217;re going to create a new 
          world, something so wonderfully terrible that even I could not conceive 
          of; it will make their last world war look like a bar brawl&#8217; smiled 
          Lucifer malevolently.<br>
          &#8216;So we must battle once more?&#8217; said Michael, unsheathing 
          a mighty sword. Jeremiel followed his lead and they advanced upon Lucifer 
          and the Count. The Count hurled two black fireballs from his hands as 
          a pack of devils emerged from the Hellmouth and fell upon the angels. 
          Desperately they cut and thrust their way through the unholy throng. 
          Irene backed up to a wall and watched with eyes wide with fascination 
          and fear. She was sickened by the slaughter of Paula and Giles and was 
          seized by indecision as to what she should do. Then she thought she 
          noticed the body of Paula move! Could it be that she still lived? As 
          the struggle raged at the other end of the cellar she stealthily made 
          her way over to her.<br>
          &#8216;Yes, she lives yet&#8217; thought Irene as she unshackled Paula.<br>
          Michael roared his battle cry as he made his way towards the Dark Lord, 
          cleaving the unnatural incarnations of evil with his mighty blade. Then 
          he noticed Jeremiel being forced back by a formidable demon wielding 
          a great axe, he feared for him, and in that moment of hesitation he 
          was overwhelmed by terrible pain. The Count had stabbed him with the 
          blade still drenched in Paula&#8217;s blood. No other earthly weapon 
          could have injured him except one used to martyr a Saint. With a last 
          great effort he turned and swung his sword in a mighty arc, decapitating 
          the Count instantly. He then sank to his knees. The battle ceased and 
          Lucifer looked down upon the dying angel:<br>
          &#8216;My time has come brother. It is written and I will rule &#8211; 
          finally!&#8217;<br>
          He looked over to see the demon about to kill Jeremiel and raised his 
          hand:<br>
          &#8216;Let him live. Go and tell your master of my victory young angel. 
          Tell him that I go to aid his beloved creation, not to lead it. Mankind 
          has redeemed itself from the good and now only serves destruction. I 
          go to observe the suffering and stand beside the great man who will 
          lead the world to Armageddon, Amen&#8217;<br>
          The Devil left the scene, followed by the remnants of his acolytes. 
          Irene turned from watching the departure to look down at Paula. To her 
          amazement Paula was standing behind her, also watching Lucifer&#8217;s 
          leaving. Her eyes glinted like diamonds.<br>
          &#8216;You, you are alive?&#8217; said Irene with fear in her voice.<br>
          Paula continued to stare at the place where the Devil had been: &#8216;I 
          swear on everything that is holy that I will kill the evil one. I will 
          follow him across the world or even the universe to fulfil this sacred 
          duty, however long it takes&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;But I saw the knife plunge into your breast, how is it that you 
          still live?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;When I was a child my doctor discovered that my heart was to 
          the right instead of the left. He said I was an unnatural child. Tell 
          me, is Giles...&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry, he died at the hand of my father; can you ever 
          forgive me for what I&#8217;ve done?&#8217; pleaded Irene.<br>
          &#8216;Help me learn the dark arts so that I may acquire the power to 
          destroy your former master and perhaps God will forgive you&#8217;<br>
          At that moment Jeremiel came up to them and as he did so a shaft of 
          light appeared from the sky enveloping Paula. Jeremiel knelt before 
          her, as did Irene following his lead. <br>
          &#8216;You are the Righteous One foretold in scripture, command us and 
          we will follow you in your holy mission&#8217; said Jeremiel.<br>
          Paula looked down on him:<br>
          &#8216;Oh do get up, I&#8217;m not the Pope, I&#8217;m just a girl from 
          New York&#8217; </font></p>

          *******************************************************<br>
          <strong>Yesterday</strong><br>
          &#8216;Whoa! Look at this place&#8217; exclaimed Pete looking at the 
          ruins of the great house.<br>
          &#8216;I don&#8217;t think we should be here&#8217; said his timid teenage 
          companion.<br>
          &#8216;C&#8217;mon, Stevie, we&#8217;ve got to check this out. How come 
          we&#8217;ve never seen it before?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Yeah, it&#8217;s weird; we&#8217;ve hiked through this area on 
          several occasions. This ruin looks like it&#8217;s been here forever&#8217;<br>
          The two youngsters approached the ivy covered remains of the Citadel. 
          Then they came to an abrupt halt, confronted by a sign nailed to what 
          was once an elaborate front door. It read:<br>
          Do not enter here unless you are beloved by God and have the courage 
          bestowed by his blessing.<br>
          &#8216;Cool&#8217; said Pete.<br>
          &#8216;You&#8217;re not going in, are you?&#8217; asked his friend.<br>
          &#8216;You betcha, c&#8217;mon, you&#8217;re not scared by that religious 
          mumbo jumbo are you?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;You are what my mother calls &#8216;a heathen&#8217; whispered 
          Stevie as they entered a broken window.<br>
          They found themselves in the great hall where the staircase led up to 
          the open sky instead of an upper floor. Everything was covered in ivy 
          and lichen. <br>
          &#8216;Over here&#8217; called Pete.<br>
          Stevie followed the voice to another great broken door. <br>
          &#8216;Where are you&#8217; he shouted.<br>
          &#8216;Man, oh man, just look at this&#8217; was Pete&#8217;s response.<br>
          Stevie could see the gleam of Pete&#8217;s flashlight at the bottom 
          of some steep steps. He carefully made his way down. As his eyes adjusted 
          to the gloom he saw what looked like a great pool of green ice surrounded 
          by skeletons of various types.<br>
          &#8216;What the hell is all this?&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;Whatever it was, it was filmed&#8217; replied Pete pointing to 
          two movie cameras.<br>
          &#8216;Wow, they were making a movie down here? Do you think the film 
          has survived?&#8217;<br>
          Pete examined one of the cameras:<br>
          &#8216;Looks intact, and it&#8217;s dark down here so I don&#8217;t 
          think the light has got to the film. This is old school technology, 
          looks like 1940&#8217;s stuff to me. My brother will know, he&#8217;s 
          studying film making &#8211; I can&#8217;t wait to see the look on his 
          face when he sees this shit&#8217;<br>
          The two friends carefully bagged one of the cameras and made their way 
          out. Stevie looked up at the sky:<br>
          &#8216;Man, it&#8217;s got dark really quickly, and it&#8217;s so cold 
          for the time of year&#8217;<br>
          &#8216;I must admit, I&#8217;ll be glad to get out of this place, it&#8217;s 
          kinda spooky&#8217; responded Pete.<br>
          The head of one of the gargoyles on the gate posts turned to follow 
          the progress of the young friends as they left.<br>
          THE END<br>
